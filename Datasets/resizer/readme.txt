	Readme.txt for JPEG Resizer
	===========================


Welcome to JPEG Resizer!

JPEG Resizer is a powerful tool for Microsoft (R)
Windows (TM) which allows you to resize lots of JPEGs
with just a few clicks.

It's packed with various advanced features such as
Anti-Aliasing, Colorization and selectable JPEG
Compression Factor.
You can choose between four different resizing methods,
specify how resized JPEGs should be named and where they
should be stored.

If you shot photos with a digital camera at a resolution
that is too high for presenting your photos on the
internet, you need to resize them. JPEG Resizer makes
this jobs quite easy as you don't need to resize each
single image for itself.

No installation or special files are required to run
JPEG Resizer. Just run the file "resizer.exe" - that's
it.

If you want to use the Command Line Edition of JPEG Resizer,
you should run "cresizer.exe". You will receive instructions
on how to use it if you call it without any parameters.

If you like this tool, feel free to redistribute it -
but please inform us about the redistribution and

Enjoy ;)
