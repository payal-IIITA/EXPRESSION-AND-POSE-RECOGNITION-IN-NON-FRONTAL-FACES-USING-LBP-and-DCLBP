1) For practical application of an expression recognition system training should not require high resolution images clicked in 
constrained environments. The system should be such that it works even on normal phone cameras.
2) Further research on how to incorporate expression recognition systems in real-life scenarios ie., extending the project to real-time facial expression recognition.
3) For incorporating continuous pose classification training should be done by generating continuous angles using 3D Face Modelling.
4) Training subjects should include people from different age groups. Training is especially important for elderly subjects due to
the confusion introduced by wrinkles and furrows in facial features.
5) Better accuracy on the pictures clicked from normal mobile phones should be achieved.
